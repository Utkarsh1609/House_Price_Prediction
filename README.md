# Linear-Regression-Model-for-House-Price-Prediction
we are creating a Machine Learning Linear Regression Model. We will be analyzing a house price predication dataset for finding out price of house on different parameters. We will do Exploratory Data Analysis, split the training and testing data, Model Evaluation and Predictions. 

## Problem Statement
A real estate agent wants help to predict the house price for regions in the USA. He gave you the dataset to work on and you decided to use Linear Regression Model. Create a model which will help him to estimate what the house would sell for.                            

Dataset contains 7 columns and 5000 rows with CSV extension. The data contains the following columns :
